## Features

- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Ensures data integrity and natural deduplication.
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Enables dynamic node joining and leaving.
- **Distributed Storage**: Improves data availability and fault tolerance.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Local caching for faster access.
- **Security**: AES encryption for data storage and transmission.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling by adding more nodes.
- **Flexible Transport Layer**: Easy implementation of different transport protocols.

## Architecture

NimbusFS consists of several key components:

1. **FileServer**: Manages file storage, retrieval, and network communication.
2. **Store**: Handles local file storage and retrieval.
      <!-- 3. **P2P Package**: Implements network transport and peer communication. -->
      <!-- 3. **Crypto Module**: Provides encryption, decryption, and hashing functionalities. -->
   will update soon
